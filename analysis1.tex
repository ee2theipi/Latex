\section*{Introduction}
\subsection*{Analysis}
Real Analysis: The analysis of real numbers and real-valued functions.
Complex Analysis: Concerns the analysis of complex numbers & complex functions.
Harmonic Analysis: Concerns the analysis of Harmonics (Waves) sine waves and how they synthesize other functions by Fourier Transform.
Functional Analysis: Focuses much more heavily on functions (on how they form things like vector spaces)

Real Analysis is the theoretical foundation underlines $calculus$, which is the collection of computational algorithms which one uses to manipulate functions.
